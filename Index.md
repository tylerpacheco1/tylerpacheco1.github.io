I am a computer science student 

Favorite Labs
Lab 1 was my favorite because it was the first one we started and started to learn more about how to start and get used to the software. We worked as a team. 

Lab 2 learned how to make my own token and run code. Team was helpful to help me and make sure we were doing it correctly 

Lab 7 commands run and input codes and fix them.
